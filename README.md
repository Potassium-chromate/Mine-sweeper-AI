# Mine-sweeper-AI
This project contains an implementation of Minesweeper game logic and an AI that can play the game. The AI reveals tiles and places flags on the board, aiming to reveal all non-mine tiles without triggering any mines. The project utilizes a graphical interface built with Pygame and a machine learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
